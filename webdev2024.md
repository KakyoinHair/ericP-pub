> This video will help you learn about the front-end developer roadmap
**What is front-end development?**
- Designing the face of a website or app
-  How things will look and feel when you use them
- Back in developers make sure everything works behind the scenes
 - Front-end developers focus on what you see and interact with on the website
- Short frontend developers turn designs into live websites and apps that people can use
> Three front-end developers around 3 main technologies which are
1. HTML
2. JS 
3. CSS
 **The important job of a front-end developer is to ensure your website design is device-friendly and user-friendly.**
> How long does it take to become a front-end developer
- 6 to 12 months of dedicated learning and practice to land an entry-level position
- If you already have some knowledge then it would be shorter
- Consistent Practice
- Be engaged with the developer community
- Continuous learning, never stop learning
**The important things to know are HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT**
> What is essential to know to grasp the foundational concepts of how the Internet function
- Understandings Domains
- The domain System
- Servers
> Protocols such as
1. e.g
2. HTTP
- Basic comprehension of web browsers and their role
- How they render web pages 
**Important to know if you are looking to venture into web development**
>HTML
1. **H**yper
2. **T**ext
3. **M**arkup
4. **L**anguage
- Corner store of web content
> Essential structure upon which everything else is built
**HTML uses tags to define elements and structure the content**
- Headings
- Paragraphs
- Links
- Images
> CODE EDITOR
**Is useful in the realm of coding**
- Syntax highlighting
- A range of extensions
- Integrated Terminal
## Notes up from 4:19 TO 8:41
**If HTML is the skeleton of a website, CSS is the skin**
> Cascading Style Sheets
*Visual appeal*
- The colors
- The fonts
- The layouts
- To create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices
- Not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing
- Userfriendly
**Javascript breathes life into static web pages**
> Dynamic programming language
- Interactivity, making websites more engaging
- More User-centric
- To simple animations
- To complex functionalities
- Form Validations
- Asynchronous Data Fetching
- Plays a Pivotal Role
**Java role is its magic behind the dynamic behavior of web applications**
> To maximize your productivity as a developer you would have to know
- How to use large language models 
- Chat GPT
- Bard
- Not only them, much more
**Knowledge of prompt engineering will help**
- To get the most helpful responses from large language models
> Front-end developers will still be needed in the future even with the newest technologies
**Software Development**
- Tracking and managing changes is crucial 
> Version Control Systems particularly git come into play
- Git helps developers to track changes
**Collborate Seamlessly**
- To revert to previous versions if needed
> GITHUB
- Host git repositories
- Facilitating collaboration
- Code sharing
- Deployment
**Package Managers**
> MPM/YARN
- Help developers manage install and update software libraries
- To make sure each project has the correct dependencies
- To make the deployment process smoother
**Bootstrap**
> Revolutionized web design
1. Offers predesigned components
2. Offers Grid systems
> Making responsive design a breeze
**Sass is a CSS pre-processor**
- Advanced Styling Techniques
**What do modern web applications demand?**
- Efficiency
- Scalability
- Maintainability
> JavaScripts Framework provide
- Libraries provide pre-written code to support these requirements
**Tailwindcss**
> gamechanger in the world of CSS Frameworks
- Adopts Utility first approach
- Rapid UI Development
- Utility Classes
- Creates custom designs
- Flexibility
- Reduces the need for custom CSS
- Faster development Cycles
**Byte**
> Next-generation front-end tooling solutions that offer
- Faster build times
- Transpiliation
- Minification
- Module Bundling
- Optimized for production ensuring the reliability and functionality of web applications is Paramount
**JAVASCRIPT TESTING TOOLS**
> Tools such as
- Jest designed for unit testing
- Cypress tailored into in testing, ensure their code functions as intended
> Regular testing minimizes bugs and enhances the overall quality of web applications
### Notes from 8:41 to the end
**TYPE SCRIPT**
> Subset of JavaScript that introduces static typing and offers
- Annotations Interfaces
- Enhanced tooling
- To more robust code
- Helps catch errors
- Issues are found before starting
**OWASP**
> Open Web Application Security Project
- Guidelines and best practices for web application security
- Common vulnerabilities
- Mitigations
- Essential for any front-end developer
- Most web apps require storing and retrieving data
**GraphQL**
> Allows clients to request only the data they need reducing fetching it
- Efficient powerful and flexible
**Astro**
  - Faster building websites
  - Less javascript
  - Faster load time
  - Offers partial hydration and integrates with various modern frameworks ensuring Flex ability and performance
> A well-designed website is not just about Aesthetics
- Performances play a critical role in the user experience on the site
- Optimizing images
- Leveraging browser caching
- Minimising server response times
*Can boost websites performance*
**React Native**
> Feels truly native to both
- Android
- IOS
# THE END
**FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT IS A DYNAMIC AND EVER-EVOLVING FIELD**
