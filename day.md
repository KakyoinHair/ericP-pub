*PC TIME*
## Afternoon and evening are my favorite time of day
1. Start up the PC
>Struggle to decide if I should game or I should be productive.
2. I usually spend a lot of time on my computer throughout the afternoon to the time I fall asleep.
This can result in getting a lot of work done or a lot of time gaming with friends.
3. A bit both
### Evening 
- Make sure my dogs are okay
- I love just hanging with friends and doing my own thing during the evening.
- I am always having a good time especially gaming or watching movies to tv shows or to random youtube videos.

During the night, I struggle to sleep so I am usually just chilling until I feel tired enough to fall asleep
> Overall my day is nothing special but I do enjoy my life and thrive to learn about web devoloper.
#### Thoughts
I feel the need to come back at the end of semester and make another day of my life to see my improvement.
